	abstract = {Detection of toxicity in online commentary is a growing branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Most research in the area rely only on text-based toxic comment detection. We propose a machine learning approach for detecting the toxicity of a comment by analyzing both the text and the emojis within the comment. Our approach utilizes word embeddings derived from GloVe and emoji2vec to train a bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (biLSTM) model. We also create a new labeled dataset with comments with text and emojis. The accuracy score of our model on preliminary data is 0.911.},

	abstract = {Given a two-dimensional polygonal space, the multi-robot visibility-based pursuit-evasion problem tasks several pursuer robots with the goal of establishing visibility with an arbitrarily fast evader. The best known complete algorithm for this problem takes time doubly exponential in the number of robots. However, sampling-based techniques have shown promise in generating feasible solutions in these scenarios. One of the primary drawbacks to employing existing sampling-based methods is that existing algorithms have long execution times and high failure rates for complex environments. This paper addresses that limitation by proposing a new algorithm that takes an environment as its input and returns a joint motion strategy which ensures that the evader is captured by one of the pursuers. Starting with a single pursuer, we sequentially construct Sample-Generated Pursuit-Evasion Graphs to create such a joint motion strategy. This sequential graph structure ensures that our algorithm will always terminate with a solution, regardless of the complexity of the environment. We describe an implementation of this algorithm and present quantitative results that show significant improvement in comparison to the existing algorithm.},
