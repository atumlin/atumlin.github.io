    - title: Graduate Researcher
      institution: Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Since August 2023, I have been working as a Graduate Research Assistant at Vanderbilt University, focusing
          on research within the VeriVital and NDS Research Labs. My main area of study involves exploring formal
          methods for the verification of neural networks. This work is essential in enhancing the safety and reliability of
          AI systems, marking a significant contribution to the field of neural network validation and verification. My role
          at Vanderbilt University demonstrates my commitment to cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and the
          development of more robust, trustworthy AI technologies.

    - title: Undergraduate Researcher
      institution: New York Institute of Technology, New York, NY
      year: 2020
      description:
        -  As a project manager and researcher, I contributed to the development of an open-source Natural Language
          Processing (NLP) algorithm designed to detect comment toxicity based on text and emojis. My work involved
          implementing a BiLSTM model that leveraged GloVe and Emoji2Vec embeddings, enhancing the algorithm's
          ability to discern toxicity accurately. This project was showcased at the 2021 REU Research in Networking and
          Systems Conference and gained further recognition with a publication in the 2021 IEEE 18th International
          Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Smart Systems (MASS). My role in this project highlights my skills in NLP,
          team leadership, and my commitment to advancing research in intelligent systems.

    - title: Undergraduate Researcher 
      institution: University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC
      year: 2020-2023
      description:
        - As an undergraduate researcher in the South Carolina Autonomous Robotics Research (SCARR) lab, I
          significantly contributed to two significant projects. My first project entailed developing an innovative multirobot visibility-based pursuit-evasion algorithm, where I optimized the program to reduce the pursuer robot's
          path by up to 75%. This groundbreaking work was published at the prestigious 2021 IEEE International
          Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). The second project focused on creating an algorithm for
          efficient information routing using ocean sensor nodes. Funded by the Magellan research grant, this research
          emphasized the practical applications of autonomous systems and was presented at Discover UofSC 2023. My
          role in these projects highlights my algorithm development and optimization skills and dedication to advancing
          research in autonomous robotics.
