Ph.D. Student in Computer Science, Research Assistant, Russell G. Hamilton Scholar

As a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, I am thrilled to have been awarded the prestigious Russell G. Hamilton Scholarship, which acknowledges exceptional students pursuing a Ph.D. My broad research interests are focused on tackling the complex issue of balancing fairness and robustness in machine learning models. Currently, I am a research assistant in both Vanderbilt's VeriVITAL and NDS Labs, where I am actively involved in researching formal methods for fairness verification.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
